# Space Game Exercise
Game I made some years ago in Pygame as a learning exercise. Not read through the code but still seems to work and has a suprising amount of bullets firing.

## Controls

* Enter to start
* Left and Right to move
* Space to fire bullets
* Left Shift to activate shields and bounce back alien bombs
